                <h2>My Origin: Nepal</h2>
                <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/17/83817-050-67C814CD/Mount-Everest.jpg" alt="Mount Everest"/>
                
               <p> Nepal is a landlocked country located in the Himalayas and bordered to the north by China and Tibet, and to the south, east, and west by India.
                    Kathmandu is the nation’s capital and the country’s largest metropolis.
               </p>    

                <p>Nepal has a rich geography; The mountainous north has eight of the world’s ten tallest mountains, including the highest point on Earth, Mount Everest.
                     It contains more than 240 peaks over 20,000 ft above sea level. The dramatic differences in elevation found in Nepal result in a variety of biomes:
                      Tropical savannas along the Indian border, subtropical broadleaf and coniferous forests in the Hill Region, temperate broadleaf and coniferous forests
                       on the slopes of the Himalaya, and grasslands and shrublands rich with rock and ice at the highest elevations.
                 </p>
                <p>Nepal is as ethnically diverse as its terrain. The Nepalese are descendants of three major migrations from India, Tibet, and central Asia. 
                    The Kathmandu Valley, in the middle hill region, constitutes a small fraction of the nation’s area but is the most densely populated.
